I (Gilbert) found myself in need of a laptop, and Edi graciously offered hers. However, the catch was that I had to reciprocate by tackling her assignment. Though she ended up with a better grade, this mafioso-style arrangement marked the beginning of our journey and our first conversation.             \n               </p>\n                <p class=\"mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600\">\n                  As we continued through our college years, our connection remained cordial until our second year. I was struggling with accounting, and Edi, ever the savior, volunteered to tutor me before the exam. In those study sessions, we not only tackled academic challenges but also shared our aspirations and the reasons behind my last-minute exam cramming.             \n                 </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"relative isolate px-6 pt-14 lg:px-8 animate-fade-in-right\">\n            <img src=\"../assets//28.jpg\" class=\"rounded-lg\" alt=\"\">\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"lg:col-span-2 lg:col-start-1 lg:row-start-2 lg:mx-auto lg:grid lg:w-full lg:max-w-7xl lg:grid-cols-2 lg:gap-x-8 lg:px-8\">\n        <div class=\"lg:pr-4\">\n          <div class=\"max-w-xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 lg:max-w-lg\">\n            <p>Faucibus commodo massa rhoncus, volutpat.
